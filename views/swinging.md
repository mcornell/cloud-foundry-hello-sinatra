    
    Would you like to swing on a star 
    carry moonbeams home in a jar 
    and be better off than you are
    or would you rather be a mule 
    
    A mule is an animal with long funny ears
    he kicks up at anything he hears
    His back is brawny but his brain is weak
    he's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
    and by the way if you hate to go to school
    You may grow up to be a mule
    
    Oh would you like to swing on a star
    carry moonbeams home in a jar
    and be better off than you are
    or would you rather be a pig
    
    A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
    his shoes are a terrible disgrace
    He has no manners when he eats his food
    He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
    But if you don't care a feather or a fig
    you may grow up to be a pig
    
    Oh would you like to swing on a star
    carry moonbeams home in a jar
    and be better off than you are
    or would you rather be a fish
    
    A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook
    he can't write his name or read a book
    to fool the people is his only thought
    and though he's slippery he still gets caught
    but if then that sort of life is what you wish
    you may grow up to be a fish
    
    a new kind of jumped up slippery fish
    
    And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
    everyday you see quite a few
    so you see it's all up to you,
    you could be better than you are
    you could be swinging on a star
